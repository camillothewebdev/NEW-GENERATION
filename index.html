            As the team manager, I have been working with Research companies or
            organizations since 2005 and as a company New Generation was created
            in 2010. Our team members and especially the manager have worked in
            various field projects in DRC. We got involved in several Projects
            with several Research companies including Research Solutions, Research
            international, RGA, NDI, TNS, Youth Dynamix, ORB, Milward Brown,
            Geopoll, Ipsos, Soland associated consults, MRC and M&C Saatchi. With
            these various companies we have managed (as individual or as a
            company) to work on the following sector specialities: Public & Social
            Sector, Tech & Telecom, Health, Retail, Oil & Gas/C-Stores, Consumer,
            Financial Services, Automotive,...

        <h1>Our Force As A Field Team</h1>
        <div class="content">

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              We have permanent team of 5 people that deal with all our projects in
              the central office and in all main cities we have teams that work with
              us on data collection in all our projects. For DRC we have a team of
              30 interviewers in Kinshasa, 10 in Lubumbashi and 5 in each of the
              other cities (Mbujimayi, Kananga, Matadi, Kikwit, Mbandaka, Kisangani,
              Goma, and Kindu). We have 7 qualitative qualified interviewers based
              in Kinshasa and they travel to work in the other cities in case of
              need.
            </p>
           
          </div>
          
        </div>
       <div class="other-info">
        <p>
          We also have 25 interviewers in Brazzaville and 1 contact person in
          each major town
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more than 55 devices (Android tablets/TECNO L9 & SMART+) which
          enable us to do Mobile Data Collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our staff and our interviewers speak French and at least 2 out of the
          4 national languages; this enables us to carry out surveys in all DRC
          provinces using major/national languages (Lingala, Kikongo, Swahili,
          and Tshiluba) spoken in the 4 major tribes of the country in addition
          to French which is the official language.
        </p>
        <p>
          All staff members have at least a bachelor degree in Law, Economics,
          Community Health, Business Communication, and etcâ€¦We also have
          registered doctors/physicians and nurses among our team members
        </p>
        <p>
          All our interviewers are able to translate the questionnaire into the
          language the respondent feels comfortable with while the main
          questionnaire is in French; so even when the questions are in French
          our interviewers are able to interact with the respondents in their
          own languages. Still we use questionnaires that are already translated
          in the local languages when required by some clients/partners.
